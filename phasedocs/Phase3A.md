# Phase 3A: Semantic RAG Engineering and Pipeline Implementation

**Project**: Neuro-Semantic Document Research Assistant (NDRA)  
**Phase**: 3A  
**Goal**: Retrieve policy clauses using ChromaDB and generate context-aware answers via Gemini Pro (RAG inference)  
**Run Date**: July 25, 2025  
**Author**: [@PardhuSreeRushiVarma20060119](https://github.com/PardhuSreeRushiVarma20060119/)

## 🚀 Objective

Implement an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to extract semantically relevant clauses from indexed insurance documents and use Google Gemini Pro to synthesize a natural language answer that is:

- Factual and policy-grounded  
- Cites the original document content  
- Includes a structured response format (YES/NO, explanation, final decision)

## Tools and Stack Used 

### 🧠 Embeddings & Semantic Search

- **Model**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  
  ✅ Lightweight, transformer-based sentence embedding model

---

### 🔎 Search & Retrieval

- **Method**: `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores()` from LangChain  
  ✅ Retrieves top-k most semantically similar document chunks

- **Top-K Retrieval Value**: `k = 5`

---

### 📜 Documents & Chunking

- **Document Source**: Multiple PDFs from `./doc/` directory

- **Chunking Function**: `chunk_text()`  
  ✅ Uses sliding window or sentence-aware segmentation (custom implementation)

- **Cosine Similarity Score**:
  ✅ Score range: `0.0` (perfect match) to `1.0` (worst match)  
  ✅ Observed results ≈ `0.33`, indicating medium-strong semantic alignment

- **Retrieval**:
  ✅ Top 5 relevant chunks returned with content preview and similarity scores

  - Query understanding (intent + metadata)  
  - Semantic rewrite of user query  
  - Clause retrieval from Chroma  
  - Structured prompt formulation  
  - Gemini response generation

## 💬 Sample Query

> **Q**: Does this policy cover knee surgery, and what are the conditions?

---

## 🔄 Semantic Rewriting

**Rewritten Query**:  
Insurance policy coverage for had knee surgery, Policy coverage. Check hospitalization expenses, surgery costs, pre-existing condition clauses, and coverage exclusions.

---

## 🧩 Structured Query Metadata

| Field            | Value            |
|------------------|------------------|
| Intent           | general_inquiry  |
| Subject          | (unspecified)    |
| Procedure        | knee surgery     |
| Age/Gender/Location | (unspecified) |
| Policy Duration  | (unspecified)    |

---

## 📥 Top Matched Clauses (ChromaDB)

1. **Clause on Day Care Procedures**:  
   *"We will pay You the medical expenses as listed under Section C, Part B, I-1 - In-patient Hospitalization Treatment for Day Care Procedures / Surgeries..."*

2. **Clause on Optional Covers**:  
   *"Pre existing condition in Life Threatening Situation, Personal Accident Covers, Emergency Evacuation..."*

3. **Policy Cancellation Clause**:  
   *"...if You have any other policy with Us or any other Insurance Company..."*

4. **Exclusion Clause**:  
   *"...Dental surgery unless due to Accidental Injury and requiring Hospitalization..."*

5. **Pre-Hospitalization Clause**:  
   *"...expenses incurred for up to 60 days before admission, provided claim is accepted under Inpatient Treatment..."*

---

## ✅ Final Gemini Response

**1. YES/NO Answer**  
Yes.

**2. Explanation**  
The policy documents indicate that surgical procedures are covered. Clause 5, "Day Care Procedures," explicitly states the policy will pay for "Day Care Procedures / Surgeries." Additionally, the clause on "Pre Hospitalisation expenses" confirms coverage by stating it applies when a claim under "Inpatient Treatment" is accepted, implying that inpatient surgery is a covered benefit.

**3. Final Decision**  
Based on the provided clauses, knee surgery is covered. The coverage is subject to the Sum Insured, sub-limits, and other general terms of the policy. Pre-hospitalization expenses are also covered for up to 60 days before admission, provided the main inpatient claim for the surgery is accepted by the insurer.

## 📏 Completeness Score

| Metric                  | Score |
|-------------------------|-------|
| Query Metadata Extraction | 0.33  |

> ⚠️ Note: The low completeness score reflects lack of structured details (e.g., patient age, gender, policy duration) in the original user query, which impacted context resolution. Enhancing metadata from users will improve this score.

---

## ⏱️ Performance Metrics

| Task            | Duration (sec) |
|------------------|----------------|
| Vector Search    | 0.1425         |
| LLM Inference    | 14.8997        |
| Total Runtime    | 23.5588        |

> ⚠️ Note: The total runtime includes both vector search latency and LLM inference time. Optimizing vector index size and embedding model could reduce latency further, This Will Be Further Implemented In **Phase-3B** For Speed Optimization.

## 🔍 Similarity Search Results (Manual Test Log)

| Rank | Similarity | Chunk Excerpt |
|------|------------|----------------|
| 1    | 0.1862     | "...SECTION C) BENEFITS COVERED UNDER THE POLICY..." |
| 2    | 0.1011     | "...MOBILITY AIDS ALLOWANCE..." |
| 3    | 0.0681     | "...Day Care Procedures..." |
| 4    | 0.0589     | "...treatment to change appearance unless for reconstruction..." |
| 5    | 0.0545     | "...claims made under these benefits will impact eligibility..." |

> 💡 **Observation**: Despite low raw cosine similarity, Gemini leveraged partial matches to generate an informed and clause-grounded response.

## 🧪 System Validation

| Module                | Status | Description                         |
|------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------|
| ChromaDB Vector Store | ✅     | 2021 indexed chunks loaded correctly |
| HuggingFace Embedding | ✅     | Same model used for query + document |
| Gemini Pro API        | ✅     | Prompt processed and returned clean response |
| Clause Retrieval Accuracy | ✅ | Top chunks semantically aligned |
| Completeness Metric   | ⚠️     | Low score due to limited structured info |

---

## 🧠 Future Work

- Improve completeness scoring with fallback metadata (age, gender, policy type)  
- Support multi-clause mapping across multiple policies (multi-source traceability)  
- Integrate contextual QA memory for follow-up queries  
- Add user feedback ranking to score clause precision  

---

## 🏁 Summary

This run validates the end-to-end pipeline of semantic clause retrieval and contextual response synthesis using RAG architecture.  
Despite a limited input query, the system successfully identified and reasoned over relevant clauses without bluffing or hallucinating responses, and demonstrating the power of combining dense vector search with structured prompting and LLM synthesis.

**✅ Phase 3A marked as COMPLETE.**
